# CiviSEPA Payment Processors

This CiviCRM extension contains two payment processors for the [CiviSEPA extension](https://github.com/Project60/org.project60.sepa).

They were originally part of CiviSEPA, but they seem to be more volatile and need more tweaking depending on your CiviCRM version and your payment processor setup.

In order to facilitate faster development cycles, these payment processors can now be developed and versioned independently from CiviSEPA.

Feel free to fork and add your own tweaks!
